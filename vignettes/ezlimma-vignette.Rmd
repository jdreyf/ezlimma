## Introduction
Welcome to `ezlimma`. This package is a wrapper for the commonly used `limma` package, which makes `limma` easier to use and offers some functionality that adds value to `limma`'s functions, such as mediation analysis and allowing for writing pathway results to Excel workbooks that link to the feature-level (e.g. gene-level) results. It exposes some of `limma`'s parameters, such as those in `lmFit`; when the parameters are not exposed, `limma`'s default is used.

## Install & load package
See README.md.

```{r}
library(limma)
library(ezlimma)
```

## Simulate data
To demonstrate the package on a dataset, I'll simulate log2 expression data with 100 genes and 6 samples in two groups with a continuous covariate. The covariate and the first gene will be associated with group. This is similar to the example data from `limma` `contrasts.fit`.

We treat this data as being already processed. For many datasets, there are zeroes or missing values that might need to be imputed; samples need to be normalized to make them comparable and amenable to statistical tests; absent genes need to be removed; sample outliers need to be assessed to examine whether some experimental variables or batch effects need to be accounted for, or the samples need to be removed or down-weighted; and trends between a gene's mean expression and its variance should be accounted for, especially in RNA-seq data, with `limma`'s `voom` function.

```{r sim}
set.seed(42)
M <- matrix(rnorm(100*6, sd=0.3), nrow=100, ncol=6)
dimnames(M) <- list(paste0("gene", 1:nrow(M)), paste0("sample", 1:ncol(M)))
M[1,1:3] <- M[1,1:3] + 2

pheno <- data.frame(grp=rep(c("First3", "Last3"), each=3), yy=rnorm(ncol(M)), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
pheno$yy[1:3] <- pheno$yy[1:3]-2
```

## Gene level analysis
Assume we want to test if genes are changed in `First3`, in `Last3`, or in `Last3 - First3`. We can do this in two lines of code,
```{r lc}
contr.v <- c(First3="First3", Last3="Last3", Last3vsFirst3="Last3-First3")
res0 <- limma_contrasts(M, grp=pheno$grp, contrast.v = contr.v)
```
`First3` tests if the mean expression of genes in these samples differs from zero, and `Last3vsFirst3` tests difference between groups. 

This returns a data frame that looks like:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(signif(res0[1:10,], 3))
```

We can test association to the continuous covariate with:
```{r}
res1 <- ezcor(M, pheno$yy, method="pearson")
```

where `method` can be any of `"pearson"`, `"kendall"`, or `"spearman"`. This returns a data frame like,
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(signif(res1[1:10,], 3))
```

Similarly, we can test association using linear regression with `limma`, where the model is *gene expression = a + bx + error*, and we test coefficient 2, i.e. the null hypothesis that *b=0*. So it returns slopes rather than correlation coefficients. The code is,
```{r}
res2 <- limma_cor(M, phenotype = pheno$yy)
```

The output is,
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(signif(res2[1:10,], 3))
```

Because this is a regression, we can test for association to `yy` while adjusting for `grp`. We do this by creating our own design matrix instead of letting `limma_cor` create one from `phenotype`.
```{r}
design <- model.matrix(~1+yy+grp, data=pheno)
res3 <- limma_cor(M, design = design)
```

which gives
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(signif(res3[1:10,], 3))
```

We can also test multiple phenotypes together. Say we had a matrix of phenotypes as
```{r}
pheno.mat <- cbind(pheno1=pheno$yy, pheno2=rnorm(ncol(M)))
```

then we could test both phenotypes together in one line, as
```{r}
res4 <- multi_cor(object=M, pheno.tab = pheno.mat, reorder.rows = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(signif(res4[1:10,], 3))
```

where the result is ordered by the combined p-value of the two associations per gene. The `method` options for the association test are: `"pearson"` (the default), `"spearman"`, `"kendall"`, as before, or `"limma"`, where it will use `limma_cor`. This function only allows one method for all phenotypes.

## Gene set level analysis
At a higher level than features (e.g. genes) lie feature sets, such as gene sets or pathways. These can be tested with `limma`'s `roast` functions, which are implemented for multiple sets at a time with the functions `mroast` or its faster approximation `fry`. We have written wrappers around these to allow for easier testing, and to make an Excel file where each gene set links to a CSV containing the statistics on its genes, made using the feature-level functions.

Let's make the gene set object,
```{r}
G <- list(list(name="pwy1", description=NA, genes=paste0("gene", 1:10)),
          list(name="pwy2", description=NA, genes=paste0("gene", 11:20)),
          list(name="pwy3", description=NA, genes=paste0("gene", 21:30)))
```

This object would normally be read in using `read_gmt`. Then we can test each of these gene sets.
```{r}
res5 <- roast_contrasts(object=M, G=G, feat.tab=res0, grp=pheno$grp, contrast.v = contr.v, fun="fry", name=NA)
```

If we set `name` to a value other than `NA`, this would create a folder with one CSV per pathway, and an Excel file that looks like
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(res5)
```

except the first column would have links to the CSVs in the folder. Similarly, we can use `roast_cor`. We can read these Excel files back into R with `read_linked_xl`.
