\title{Fisher Exact Test of gene set enrichment with output to Excel}
\usage{
fisher_enrichment(sig.sets, G, feat.tab = NULL, name = NA,
  adjust.method = "BH", min.nfeats = 3, max.nfeats = 1000,
  pwy.nchar = 199)
}
\arguments{
\item{sig.sets}{Named list whose elements are a vector of significant gene IDs matching \code{rownames(feat.tab)}.}

\item{G}{Gene set list as returned from \code{\link{read_gmt}}.}

\item{feat.tab}{Table of feature (e.g. gene) statistics that the Excel table can link to.}

\item{name}{Name for the folder and Excel file that get written. Set to \code{NA} to avoid writing output.}

\item{adjust.method}{Method used to adjust the p-values for multiple testing. Only for \code{mroast}.}

\item{min.nfeats}{Minimum number of features (e.g. genes) needed in a gene set for testing.}

\item{max.nfeats}{Maximum number of features (e.g. genes) needed in a gene set for testing.}

\item{pwy.nchar}{Numeric maximum number of characters allowed in pathway name.}
}
\value{
Data frame of gene set statistics.
}
\description{
Test enrichment of one or more vectors of significant genes against the universe of genes in \code{feat.tab} per 
gene set using \code{\link[stats]{fisher.test}}. It returns a data frame with statistics per gene set, and can 
write this to Excel. The Excel file links to CSV files, which contain statistics per genes in a set.
}
\details{
Pathway (i.e. gene set) names are altered to be valid filenames in Windows and Linux. Numeric columns are
rounded to 3 significant figures.

\code{feat.tab} is needed if \code{!is.na(name)}.
